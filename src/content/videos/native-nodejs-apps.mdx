> This was my first talk at JSLA. At the time I had given talks quite a bit a meetup called Riverside.JS. I love looking back on this talk because it was just at the time when [**electron**](https://github.com/electron/electron) was split into its own project. I do not even think that I name electron at all because at the time it was called atom-shell.

Native NodeJS apps are a relatively new breed of apps coming out of the NodeJS community that combine NodeJS and Webkit. Ill be going over

- what are the options out there
- what kind of things can these apps do compared to webapps
- what are the current pro/cons of making a NodeJS native

Native NodeJS apps are a relatively new breed of apps coming out of the NodeJS community that combine NodeJS and Webkit.

so how's everybody doing
0:07
um my name is jacob and i'm going to be
0:09
talking about native node.js apps
0:13
i'm on github it's my username for
0:15
github i'm going to have i have some
0:17
relevant material up there so if you
0:19
want to go check that out um all my
0:21
demos will be up there as well
0:22
i work full time at a company called
0:24
honey inc we make embeddable
0:26
quizzes and and ads and stuff it's
0:29
really cool um we're looking uh we have
0:32
some job openings up on our website um
0:35
if you're interested come talk to me
0:36
afterwards and then i'm also an
0:38
ambassador for syngrid
0:41
so you might be thinking like what is a
0:42
native node.js app
0:45
you can almost say like isn't all
0:47
node.js apps native because you can
0:49
essentially run c code from them so
0:52
i don't know how much more native you
0:54
can get
0:56
well yeah they are they are native
0:58
node.js apps but i'm i was trying to
1:00
think like what
1:02
should i call these type of apps because
1:04
there's not really like a a
1:05
qualification or like a marketing term
1:07
for these type of apps so like it's not
1:09
a web app at all because it does so much
1:12
more than a web app it would be kind of
1:13
degrading to it to say hey it's a web
1:15
app
1:16
a native web app is actually a little
1:17
bit better but it's it's not a web app
1:20
at all because a kind of a web app like
1:22
implies that it can be ran on a browser
1:24
which if you run a heavily modified
1:27
browser you can run these apps but not
1:29
really on a regular web browser
1:32
node.js app it is kind of a node.js app
1:35
but like when you say node.js app
1:38
you're usually talking about something
1:39
like a web server or some type of
1:41
networking server or even though it can
1:43
be a number of things and then like
1:46
native node.js app is kind of lame as
1:48
well i mean i don't like it i think we
1:50
could do a little bit better
1:52
so like super effing cool way to use
1:54
webtech to make a native-esque type of
1:57
app
1:58
i like that a lot better
2:00
so but really what i'm talking about is
2:03
a lightweight version of a browser
2:05
and then the runtime of the browser is
2:08
replaced with node.js runtime which is
2:10
really cool and i say most instances
2:13
because there's a lot of choices
2:15
um well not a lot of choices but there's
2:17
multiple choices to this
2:19
and and luckily they're open source as
2:20
well
2:22
so
2:23
the first one i'm going to talk about is
2:26
desk shell now desk shell
2:28
has been around for a while
2:30
it's
2:31
not that actually actively developed but
2:34
it is very close to a web app you
2:37
essentially are running a web app that
2:39
interacts with the backend
2:41
and they're kind of they're it used to
2:42
be called app.js and i think they
2:44
changed the name because they're looking
2:45
to support php i don't know if that's
2:46
considered like a bad thing about this
2:49
type of app but
2:52
um and then the big guy that i think
2:54
most of you have probably heard about is
2:56
a node webkit it's very full featured
2:58
i've built apps in node webkit it is
3:00
very cool they even have a grunt plugin
3:02
to pack applications which is just
3:04
awesome
3:05
like you have no idea
3:07
it is kind of slow to start up
3:10
and there's a number of reasons for that
3:13
and actually i was going to talk about
3:15
node webkit throughout this whole entire
3:17
presentation
3:18
um but then something happened uh this
3:21
month and just for reference for people
3:23
who are watching this online this is may
3:25
of 2014
3:27
so what happened is that
3:29
github
3:31
released their atom ide to open source
3:33
which i thought was great i mean a new
3:35
project that's open source it's using
3:37
very similar technologies i've actually
3:39
speculated with a lot of my friends that
3:40
they're using node webkit
3:42
in atom to build this ide
3:45
but they actually hired on one of the
3:47
core developers of node webkit to build
3:50
adam shell
3:51
which is very actively developed because
3:54
it's
3:55
from github and it acts just like
3:57
node.js runtime
3:59
it is missing a few key features because
4:01
really it was just built to run their
4:03
ide and now they're just open sourcing
4:05
it so eventually they'll get these
4:06
features like uh for instance you can't
4:08
even set like an icon to the app very
4:10
easily grant you can do it but you have
4:13
to kind of hack around to do it compared
4:15
to like what you can do in node webkit
4:18
so before i talk about like
4:20
how cool these things are these types of
4:22
apps there is some things to think about
4:24
before you like try to build a
4:25
production app with one of these
4:28
so it's different i mean this is with
4:30
all new technology it's going to be
4:32
different um for instance like things
4:34
like live reload will not work right off
4:37
the bat with it maybe actually this
4:39
stuff's being actively developed pretty
4:40
quick so there actually might be a
4:42
plug-in for live reload now
4:44
but at the time of making this there
4:45
wasn't
4:46
and like
4:47
it's it's just weird and like for
4:49
instance have you ever made a web app
4:51
that you've never had that you don't
4:53
have access to the window object like
4:56
you always have access to that where you
4:57
can like just store stuff in there and
4:59
you can just pull stuff right back out
5:01
these types of apps you don't have that
5:02
capability
5:04
sometimes you have it'll
5:06
access window a lot of times though
5:08
and then like there's something that we
5:10
don't have to deal with as web
5:12
programmers that you have to deal with
5:14
with these type of apps which is like
5:15
uses on different os's usually these
5:17
browsers just work on these different
5:19
os's and you have to worry about you
5:21
know the actual processes and stuff
5:23
but um
5:25
you have the same
5:26
browser but now you you're storing data
5:28
into different locations i actually have
5:31
an app that i built that like
5:33
i had a friend on a mac computer that
5:35
couldn't run it just for some stupid
5:37
reason
5:39
um but yeah that's one thing to look out
5:41
for
5:42
um and then actually uh the app store
5:44
like a lot of people are trying to like
5:45
release these apps the app store i've
5:47
heard a lot of nightmare situations
5:48
where they didn't uh pass
5:50
uh the app store and then i've actually
5:54
heard of a few node webkit ones that
5:56
have
5:57
but um adam shell i guess there's people
5:59
trying to do it but a few of the github
6:01
employees don't think that they're gonna
6:04
pass
6:05
and then it's experimental like some of
6:07
the features that you've used on web and
6:10
that you've come to love or on node.js
6:13
some of those features just don't work
6:15
like
6:16
granted you can get native plugins to
6:17
work npm modules that run c code but
6:20
like there is catches for instance like
6:22
adam shell
6:23
is only running version 0
6:26
0 11 9 is the first version that it came
6:29
out with so if you have a native plugin
6:30
that's running at 0 10
6:33
only is compatible with 0 10 versions of
6:35
node
6:36
you're going to run into a lot of issues
6:37
because they did a lot of changes with
6:38
native bindings
6:40
but there is before i blame you guys out
6:42
there is a lot of exciting stuff about
6:44
this app about these types of apps and
6:46
one thing that really excites me is that
6:47
like w3 standards they have a bunch of
6:50
different specs that come out all the
6:51
time that like are just like
6:53
experimental sometimes or sometimes you
6:56
know have been around for a while but
6:58
actually these features can be built by
6:59
just your regular
7:01
javascript programmer so they can start
7:03
playing with these types of things right
7:05
away and actually what's cool is that
7:06
you can actually learn these
7:07
technologies before they even come out
7:09
in browsers so when they do come out
7:11
it's not something new to you
7:14
and then you actually have control over
7:15
the browser as a web programmer there's
7:17
always been that moment where you just
7:19
like curse ie8 you know to all hell
7:22
where like something's broken you don't
7:24
know why you actually control
7:26
the the browser that you're running on
7:28
which is great which means you can run
7:30
you know all the cool apis that that
7:32
browser gives you
7:34
um
7:35
it's it isn't just a node.js app it does
7:38
so much more like it has a gui that
7:40
isn't a terminal i mean i don't know how
7:42
many times you know
7:44
a client has asked you for a terminal
7:46
program that they can play around with
7:48
because it doesn't happen because
7:49
clients usually want something that's
7:51
nice and pretty and something that has
7:53
an actual gui not just a terminal
7:55
program
7:57
it this is for people who like
8:00
hate saying setting up dbs or they just
8:02
don't want to do it
8:03
it actually has built-in web storage so
8:05
if you wanted to actually get up and
8:06
started without having to set up
8:07
something like leveldb or our uh
8:10
mysql or sqlite or something some
8:13
embeddable database it actually already
8:15
has indexeddb and local storage and all
8:17
that kind of cool stuff in it so you can
8:20
get started really quick
8:21
and it has a real dom i don't know how
8:23
important this is to you but
8:25
you can actually interact with this dom
8:26
and see things happening where like if
8:28
you use js dom and stuff it feels kind
8:30
of abstract
8:31
you're interacting with it but it's it's
8:33
kind of you know something that is um
8:36
very abstract
8:38
and then you have access to native
8:39
features and i'm talking about like
8:41
native gui features like menus menu bars
8:44
windows docs start menu and actually i
8:47
have a demo here of a
8:49
node webkit app
8:51
um and this is a note-taking app that
8:54
syncs up with gist and actually you have
8:56
access to
8:58
as you can see here i have you know
9:00
access to the file menu
9:01
when i like try to switch apps you see
9:03
that it's in here
9:05
let me close that
9:07
so you actually have access to those
9:08
types of things which is great because
9:11
like you i granted you could probably do
9:12
that with a regular node.js app but you
9:14
have to hack around to get to it and
9:16
then it's like kind of awkward without a
9:17
window to actually show a gui in
9:21
so all those things were about like node
9:23
uh like web apps like what abs what uh
9:26
what web apps do compared to node.js
9:28
apps so i want to explain why it's not
9:31
just a web app
9:33
so you have access to node.js apis like
9:36
streams file system child processes all
9:38
kinds of really cool stuff built in and
9:41
i'm not talking about like file access
9:43
like you would have in chrome or file
9:45
access that you would have like through
9:47
browserify or something you actually
9:49
have access to the whole file system
9:51
which is great we'll grant it you have
9:52
the permissions
9:55
um and then synchronous module imports
9:58
these are really great where you just
9:59
like
10:00
require something and it's there
10:03
where like i i can hear you saying like
10:05
oh whatever you know you can you you can
10:08
actually do this stuff with component i
10:10
o or or browserify so why is that
10:13
important
10:14
but actually you have like access to
10:16
like all the npm modules on npm granted
10:19
there are some um some gotchas where
10:22
like with native modules and stuff like
10:24
that where
10:25
they kind of don't work um sometimes but
10:28
a lot of the modules will work right out
10:30
of the box
10:32
and one thing that's really cool is that
10:33
you can actually interact with installed
10:35
programs like git python or like your
10:38
keychain or something and actually i
10:39
have another demo showing this
10:42
so i'm going to go to my terminal
10:45
switch over
10:48
and i'm going to go
10:53
so i'm going to start up the app this is
10:54
actually an adam shell app
10:58
as you can see it's showing me like a to
11:00
do of like a a to do md
11:04
and actually i'll go into my editor
11:07
and i'll open up this one let me bring
11:09
that back
11:11
so
11:12
um
11:13
let's say i want to
11:14
check off like we went to the the kitty
11:17
bar afterwards
11:18
so i save that and then you'll see
11:21
that it should update
11:25
so it updated so i'm actually
11:26
interacting with git here
11:28
i'm actually
11:29
just running a
11:31
um
11:33
a child process to
11:35
run git right here so i spawn a get
11:39
process and then i just spit that the
11:41
output straight to the the uh
11:44
the window
11:46
which is really cool because i didn't
11:47
have to set up web sockets or or
11:49
anything crazy to get that running i
11:51
just it was it felt kind of natural
11:53
those things just interacting with each
11:54
other
11:56
and then also another really cool thing
11:58
is that i have access to hardware now i
12:00
have another demo here
12:03
and i'm not a hardware guy so
12:05
it's just a little bit of a warning so i
12:07
have this arduino board hooked up to a
12:11
like a breadboard with an accelerometer
12:13
on here
12:14
and then i have a demo app
12:23
that i'm going to run and is anybody
12:25
epileptic because i'm going to change
12:27
the background color of this thing
12:29
pretty quickly
12:31
yeah
12:34
oh actually real quick it's going to
12:35
throw an air
12:37
and that is because
12:39
i need to be sudo to get access to the
12:41
usb port
12:45
okay
12:46
so give it a second it's going to start
12:49
turning colors
12:50
so actually the wiring is probably off
12:53
on here because i'm not a uh
12:56
a uh
12:57
hardware guy but i can actually move
12:59
this thing around and it will change
13:01
colors and sometimes you'll get some
13:02
pretty colors out of it
13:04
but
13:05
yeah so i'm actually talking directly to
13:07
the app from this piece of hardware
13:09
which i mean i don't know of any web
13:12
apps that can really do that and i'm
13:14
using uh johnny five and
13:16
some hackery to to get this thing
13:18
working on adam's shell it's kind of a
13:20
pain to get that kind of stuff working
13:22
but yeah
13:23
my name is jacob and thanks
13:41
um so you can't run these things on
13:43
mobile phones right now just because you
13:45
would have to install like an apk or
13:49
an actual like ios app and these things
13:51
are mainly for desktop currently so but
13:55
you can have access to the camera of the
13:57
computer
13:59
but again you can do that kind of stuff
14:00
with web apps as well with get user
14:02
media and stuff like that
14:07
so if you were starting a new project
14:09
would you use node webkit or or adam
14:11
michelle
14:12
okay so
14:13
i should have said this before but the
14:14
main difference between adam's shell and
14:16
node webkit is that
14:19
node webkit your entry point is like an
14:21
html file so you essentially you render
14:24
that html file and then you start
14:25
running the scripts on that html page
14:28
and that's how you start up a node
14:29
webkit app
14:30
and with adam's shell it's different
14:33
because you have an entry point of a
14:35
js file so you actually start running
14:38
the js process and then you can open up
14:41
windows when your app's ready which is
14:42
kind of good with like
14:44
perceived uh performance like oh it's
14:47
opening up real fast but really you're
14:49
just waiting before and then opening up
14:51
the app
14:52
i would have to say
14:53
i would probably use adam's shell
14:56
well
14:57
it depends because if i
14:59
if the the timeline was like a month
15:02
probably node webkit because i need a
15:04
lot of the features that node webkit has
15:06
but if let's say it's like six months
15:09
adam shell probably will catch up in
15:11
terms of like the nice features like
15:13
icons and stuff like that in six months
15:16
so i would probably for a longer project
15:18
picked adam shell
15:21
it's written in coffee script oh yeah
15:23
that is the down part but
15:25
luckily you can interact with it with
15:27
javascript
15:30
okay um i think this is probably not a
15:34
fair question for you but i've been
15:35
using atom editor and
15:38
ui wise visual
15:40
it's awesome i love it but performance
15:42
wise
15:43
it's really sluggish
15:46
yes
15:47
you can speak on that at all so you is
15:50
you're essentially you're not completely
15:51
native you're still running a web
15:53
browser you're dealing with all the the
15:55
rendering of a web browser i mean it's
15:57
the same performance issues that you
15:58
would run into with a regular web
16:00
browser
16:01
right now it's not completely optimized
16:05
and i don't think there's you know
16:07
there's stuff that they can do
16:09
eventually to to optimize that but i
16:11
yeah i don't know i guess i'm just like
16:14
it's almost a proxy question for you i
16:16
want to ask when i said get up but like
16:18
are they aware of it
16:20
yeah they are aware of it actually i i
16:22
saw recently they pushed a big update
16:23
for scrolling speeds that's supposed to
16:25
improve the scrolling speeds actually i
16:27
have a linux box so i haven't really had
16:30
the the
16:31
the royalties of getting to use atom uh
16:34
the the actual ide
16:35
until recently so
16:37
yeah i don't
16:39
yeah i think they're they're doing stuff
16:40
to make the performance a little bit
16:42
better but it's still not completely
16:43
native
16:49
can we see the code for the hardware
16:51
yeah
16:53
so in the hardware
16:56
i just require the app here let me blow
16:58
this up
16:59
a little bit
17:04
so i require the app and then with adam
17:07
they have like this browser window and
17:08
then this is johnny five it's just a
17:11
module that i had to install
17:13
and then i just make a new board
17:15
when the board's ready i
17:17
make an accelerometer which is
17:21
talking to this thing and then when the
17:23
accelerometer inputs change i emitted
17:26
event
17:27
and let's see if we scroll over
17:28
accelerometer change and that just sends
17:31
out the data to that event
17:34
and here i'm just opening up the window
17:35
when the app is ready
17:37
and then actually the html file
17:41
so you have to do like background
17:43
require remote and then as you see from
17:45
the background i can require the app
17:48
and then in here
17:49
see this is converting it all
17:52
and right here i listen to the change
17:53
event so i grab the app and i look for
17:55
that excel change and then i handle the
17:58
change which then does some conversion
18:01
stuff to make it a little bit more like
18:02
rgb
18:05
than it comes out as
18:11
right here so
18:13
i guess given some of the like cross
18:17
uh cross os compatibility issues like
18:20
when
18:21
what would be the primary use case for
18:23
this like when would you say yeah we'll
18:25
do
18:26
we'll use uh node webkit rather than
18:29
just we'll build a node app and we'll
18:32
tell people to run it in webkit
18:35
um so
18:36
i think the main use case is when you
18:39
need something that's um
18:43
you want to build like a node app that
18:45
that has some good performance and you
18:47
want to write node code but you also
18:49
want access to some modules that you can
18:52
then like pull out bluetooth or some
18:55
technology that's just not quite there
18:58
plus like
19:00
for instance i i reference the the
19:02
service worker api or spec that's coming
19:05
out um
19:06
and like there's gonna they're gonna do
19:08
a lot of like network proxy next network
19:11
proxy and stuff with that to make like
19:13
caching really good in a browser but
19:16
with like this type of stuff you can
19:17
already do like those types of things to
19:19
where you can have really good caching
19:21
and really good you know uh access
19:24
really good like um
19:25
access to cash assets and stuff
19:29
so i would say like if you're doing
19:30
something with hardware it's a definite
19:31
go because
19:33
i don't know when you're ever going to
19:34
be able to like connect up a usb to
19:36
arduino board and then run like a web
19:38
app
19:39
um
19:40
but besides that there's there is i mean
19:43
there's a lot of cool things about it
19:45
but really uh
19:47
there's not too many differences from
19:50
the web platform which is kind of nice
19:52
in itself because then you can you know
19:54
have very similar code bases if you
19:55
wanted to make a web app in one of these
19:57
kind of like native esk apps
20:01
uh give it up for jacob
20:11
you`}
