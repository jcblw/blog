Module of the month was a small series at jsla in which people of the community would give talks about a specific module in the nodejs ecosystem. This months talk was about Babel.

I would be talking about a Babel or
0:08
Babel depends on where you're at and how
0:11
you call it but essentially Babel is a
0:15
trance compiler that will take next
0:18
generation JavaScript and turn it into
0:20
readable es5 JavaScript which means that
0:23
you can then run it on node or on a
0:27
browser at least some of the more modern
0:30
browsers there's still some that you
0:32
can't run it on and I say next
0:35
generation because it's not only es6 but
0:38
actually it's also es7 because like es6
0:42
now has been like finalized and we're
0:45
going to start seeing it roll into some
0:46
of the newer browsers usually the ones
0:48
that we use but es7 is a lot of
0:52
proposals and whatnot but a lot of the
0:54
people behind babel are you know at the
0:57
forefront of this so they're writing
0:59
these things out so that they can start
1:00
playing with these different proposals
1:03
but they're behind experimental flags so
1:05
don't worry you don't have to mess with
1:07
them if you don't want you so here's a
1:10
website there's like a ton of good
1:13
instructions on here on how to use this
1:15
thing I'm going to show you a few
1:16
examples of how to use this thing that
1:19
hopefully will apply to something that
1:21
you can actually start using so the
1:25
first thing is that it's a COI tool but
1:29
you can also use it programmatically
1:30
with in JavaScript I'm going to be using
1:32
the CLI tool but pretty much the options
1:34
come across the same exact way so first
1:37
off we need to start writing some es6
1:39
code so let me write so those classes in
1:45
es6 oh I'm gonna lie to class I'm just
1:47
going to make a class foo and it's going
1:51
to need a constructor and as you can see
1:54
this doesn't look like JavaScript the
1:57
stuff that we write this is totally
1:59
different and actually what I want to do
2:01
is pass them like options to this but
2:04
I'm also going to give it like a default
2:05
argument so that way it's always an
2:07
object I can count on it being that and
2:09
we'll just console.log that out just to
2:13
say just to show you that this is
2:16
working so type of
2:18
options and we're also going to do like
2:23
a basic like greet function part create
2:26
method we're going to use we're going to
2:29
pass an argument of name and then we're
2:32
going to return a hello name as you can
2:41
see there i'm actually using string
2:42
interpolation nu te s six so now we want
2:47
to actually do something with this so
2:49
I'm just going to say Const foo is equal
2:53
to new foo I'm going to pass anything to
2:56
it so that way we can see default
2:58
arguments working and then we're going
3:00
to say console.log and then food 3gs la
3:11
now let's say I want to run this on node
3:15
I'm a no developer I just want to run an
3:18
es6 file so babel comes with not only
3:21
the Babel command which as you can see
3:24
it will do nothing if I don't pass
3:26
anything but also Babel node which is
3:30
one's kind of straightforward
3:30
essentially you're running Babel inside
3:33
of node or you're essentially doing a
3:35
wrapper around node that will then
3:37
transform all of your code into es6 or
3:40
transfer all of your ESX code into es5
3:42
so it can be run on node so all I'm
3:45
going to do is point it towards this
3:47
file which is in Babel node directory
3:49
let's see and then index or is it mean
3:54
what is it mean
4:03
yeah ah sorry about that sorry guys I'm
4:21
terrible at spelling and then I got to
4:26
fix the other one again alright cool so
4:30
we got the type of object so actually
4:32
didn't pass anything there the default
4:34
arguments worked in hello JSL a witch
4:36
did string interpolation but as you can
4:38
see I didn't it didn't show any of the
4:40
compilation it did it on the fly while I
4:42
was running inside of node let's say
4:44
you're not lucky to use note at your
4:46
your work or any of your projects you
4:49
just write client apps so you need to be
4:52
able to trans compile this which is the
4:55
regular Babel command so what I'm going
4:57
to do is I'm going to take my contents
4:59
in this file and I'm going to go over
5:01
into this file here we're just gonna
5:03
paste over what's here so we already
5:06
know a console logs out object and hello
5:08
j SLA so what I'm going to do is I'm
5:11
going to run instead of Babel node I'm
5:14
just going to run Babel and then I'm
5:15
going to pass it my file which was in
5:20
extra j/s now as you can see it just
5:22
output it to the standard out what I'm
5:24
going to do is I'm actually just going
5:25
to copy this right now and it's readable
5:30
to a certain extent there's some crazy
5:32
stuff in here and I'm going to take this
5:36
over into my browser so you can see this
5:39
is just es5 code and we have the console
5:43
log object in hello jla so we trans
5:46
compiled es6 code and we're now running
5:49
it inside of a browser granted you don't
5:51
want to copy and paste it from your
5:53
standard out and then paste it into your
5:55
browser's console that's not logical so
5:59
well you can deal with Babel is you can
6:02
actually output it to a file so I'm just
6:04
going to do it out to a file called
6:06
compiled without the dash
6:11
it's going to be dash oh so da show is
6:14
output or you can do dash dash out push
6:17
output file its going to run so it
6:21
compiled it and we'll just run that on
6:22
node with regular note command and then
6:26
compilation and then compiled and as you
6:29
can see it's the same thing so that ran
6:31
a lot faster I don't know if you noticed
6:33
with the last time I ran it ran pretty
6:35
slow because it was compiling the files
6:36
and then running them so let's say
6:39
you're like using something like a
6:41
puddle electron project well you don't
6:44
really have access to node so you can't
6:46
really like be like oh I'm going to use
6:47
babel node to run it in that instance
6:51
you don't really have a way to you
6:53
besides there's this thing called a
6:56
Babel register which will allow you to
6:59
register all of the required statements
7:01
inside of node and pretty much hook into
7:04
that and then compile those things while
7:06
you're essentially requiring them in of
7:09
course it's a little bit slower you're
7:11
doing compilation but it does work so i
7:14
have this required transform slightly
7:17
es6 file here it's just another foo
7:20
class i'm doing some more stuff with it
7:23
passing some arguments to it and pulling
7:25
things out but also have this index file
7:28
so this is es5 it's actually a little
7:31
bit of es6 just the cost but i'm running
7:33
in I ojs so I can actually use those
7:36
type of things and as you can see like
7:39
I'm just using required it's it looks
7:41
like basic codes that maybe you work
7:43
with on a day-to-day basis except i have
7:45
require Babel and then / register so
7:49
what I can do with this is actually now
7:51
I can run node and then the required
7:55
transform and then the index file and as
8:00
you can see it console logged all my
8:02
stuff out we can go back and verify that
8:04
those are the right things but actually
8:06
I'm able to run es6 code in files that I
8:10
require so the base the only thing that
8:12
sucks about this is that the base file
8:13
your entry point file has to be es5 you
8:16
can try to es6 inside of it because
8:18
essentially we're just overriding the
8:19
requires statement so that's really cool
8:23
so you're able to now use it inside of
8:26
node you're able to use it inside of a
8:29
client app there's actually things for
8:31
doing like if you were to use browserify
8:35
there's babe laughs I there's gold Babel
8:38
they have plugins for everything it's
8:40
really cool it's like production ready
8:43
there's a ton of people already using a
8:45
Babel and it's you know Yahoo's using it
8:48
I actually have a list here because they
8:51
have it all over their website
8:53
cloudflare Netflix Airbnb is actually
8:56
using some really cool projects ghost
8:58
Adam the editor which I would have been
9:01
editing the stuff on so it's really cool
9:03
I suggest you know even if you don't
9:07
really like doing trance compiling stuff
9:08
you want to play around with the new
9:10
version of the language download Babel
9:12
and just play around with it and see if
9:14
you can actually make something thank
9:16
you
