I sat cramped in the backseat of my grandfather's truck. My grandpa, my cousin, and I were on our way to spread my grandfather's mother's ashes in Bishop, California. We did some tent camping for a few days. On one of those days, we went on a small hike. It was nothing special, to me, just a wander through the brush. The trail was off the side of the road in the corner of the park. The camping trip we went on is a fond memory of mine, but the hike was just a small moment in that adventure.

I remember a point in the hike we had stopped, after passing some cows, just in some brush near the riverside. The air was dry, and you could hear subtle songs of insects. Under the beating sun, we sat at this place for what seems like only a few seconds. I believe it was half to catch our breaths, but also there was a tension in the air you could almost grasp it. I could sense there was something up with my grandfather. My grandfather's eyes became watery, and I remember the exact moment he threw his mothers ashes into the bush towards the river. At first, when thinking about the spread of ashes, I felt there was not much effort to it. Almost like he was rushing to turn around and get back to camp. I think my initial interpretation was incorrect.

Looking back, I did not take into account the pain and closure that he was going through. How tough of a moment that must have been for my grandpa. At that moment, my grandfather was laying his mother to rest, setting her free. He experienced significant emotional distress, a pain of letting go of a loved one, and the act of untethering his soul from an old sturdy anchor.

The trip was one of the few amounts of camping trips I got to experience with my grandfather. He is the one that introduced me to the love of nature. I feel like I grew in several ways on those trips, and I like to think that at the riverside, that day, my grandfather grew as well.

Losing my grandfather has made me reflect on these moments. I feel like I have a compass that has an arrow spinning in circles. My soul is flailing, unable to find guidance without the direction it once had. It is painful, so damn painful. The only thing I can do now is to feel these emotions running through me. I can learn from these feelings and allow myself to nurture these moments and grow from them.
