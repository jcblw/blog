I've come to the difficult decision to discontinue the Mujō web extension. While it's been a labor of love for some time, there are a few key reasons I've chosen to take this step.

## It Deserves More Attention Than I Can Give

Despite my best intentions, there were times the extension became glitchy—becoming unresponsive or providing a subpar user experience. This isn't what I envisioned or want for my users. The quality should always be paramount.

## AI-Predicted Breaks Became Costly

I'm no AI engineer, and while our predictive AI technology did its job, it came at a significant cost—one that's no longer justifiable for me. I could've considered external services for more affordable predictions, but I didn't want to compromise user data by involving third parties.

# What's on the Horizon for Mujō?

The future direction of Mujō is still taking shape, but I've been mulling over a few possibilities for when the right opportunity arises.

## Pivoting to Mobile

The shift towards mobile has been undeniable, and it's imperative for me to align with this evolving landscape.

## Improving AI Models

Currently, I'm working with limited datasets for training the Mujō model. I believe there's potential for enhancement—if we can develop a superior model and adopt a more refined approach to training.
