## Journey to a new climate cognition

I am not sure about you, but I have a mission statement for life. I created one a few years back when hearing a talk from [Jeff Weiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/) at [Headspace](https://headspace.com/) when I worked there. It was an exciting concept because it was a very general statement that could make it super simple to decide. Does this new job follow my mission statement? If no, I could immediately say no. My mission statement at the time of writing this is as follows:

> To increase access to new experiences around the world.

This statement may seem vague, and that is on purpose. I wanted enough specificity to make it easy to make a decision but not so specific that I would be limited. I think of travel, the outdoors, adventure, and preservation when I hear this statement. Preservation since if the experience goes away, no one can access it. We are in a [climate](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3246/nasa-says-2022-fifth-warmest-year-on-record-warming-trend-continues/) crisis, and some experiences are becoming extinct.

I was in the market for a new job at the beginning of this year and wanted to use my skill sets to help fight climate change. I stumbled on a listing for an app called [Commons](https://thecommons.earth). Commons was super interesting to me for several reasons, but one huge one was that I needed to figure out how well I was doing regarding my carbon emission. I felt I was doing well but did not know how to tell. Having this information made it super easy to see my environmental well-being.

I am only going to speak briefly about what Commons does. At the time of writing this, I have only started working there, and I still need to explore all the offerings Commons has.

Commons calculates your emissions based on prior transactions. Is it perfect? No. Does it open a window into your environmental impact? Yes. I have been using the app for a while now. I hooked up my credit cards to the application and watched in horror at the impact of some of my past purchases. [Follow me on Commons](https://j09c5.app.link/QRWJqg8XVxb) to see my progress.

In addition to tracking your transactions, Commons also sends emails with tips on reducing your carbon emissions and a "Practice" tab that provides ideas on how to make more significant changes in your life to make it more sustainable. This feature allows users to take meaningful steps toward environmental well-being beyond just tracking their emissions.

## Opening my eyes to my impact

Since starting work at Commons, I can see why climate change is so complicated. I had some ideas, but after seeing the emissions from my transactions it was clearer where I stood, and it was not excellent.

### Climate cognition?

This mindset came up in a conversation with [Sanchali Pal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanchalipal/), and it makes total sense. Here is how I define it.

> Climate cognition is awareness and relationship with your environment and how individuals' decisions impact that relationship.

Talking about mental health was unheard of just a decade ago, and climate cognition is another step. How is your health when it comes to your relationship with your environment?

Over the past couple of weeks, I have been making a more significant effort to change my lifestyle to be more environmentally friendly. I started by reducing my meat consumption and buying more locally sourced produce. I also began walking places instead of driving, which has reduced my carbon emissions and improved my physical fitness and mental health. Making these changes has not only benefited the environment but has also been making my life better overall. This blog post is only the start of my journey, but I am excited to see where it takes me.
