[React containers](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) have been a popular pattern in the React ecosystem for years, but with the rise of state management libraries like [Relay](https://relay.dev/), [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/), [Jotai](https://jotai.org/), and [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) their relevance comes into question. As a seasoned React developer, I've used a variety of state management tools, but I've found that React containers still have a place in modern React applications. In this blog post, I'll explain what React containers are, why they were popular in the past, and why I still use them in 2023. Whether you're a new or experienced React developer, I hope this post will provide insights into how React containers can help you build an amazing app and define an repeatable architecture in your code.

### React containers

React container is a component that's responsible for managing the state and behavior of one or more child components. The container component is usually a "smart" component, meaning that it has access to the application's state and can modify it as needed. The child components of this "smart" component are usually "dumb" components, meaning that they don't have direct access to the state and receive data and behavior from the container via props.

React containers was a popular pattern in React applications because they help manage complex stateful logic in a predictable and scalable way. By separating stateful logic from presentational logic, you can create more modular and reusable components that are easier to test and maintain. React containers were particularly popular in the past because there weren't as many state management libraries available and state often was stuck in one component. At the time there was not even a stable context API to share the state deeply into a tree of components.

Another benefits of using React containers, is the ability to have a consistent pattern across the codebase. I found that without these paterns React applications will often become a soup of functionality, especially when working on larger teams. For some reason a new API call is happening, or doubling up because there is a component added that decided it needed to make an API call. The container pattern, enforced that the state and behavior all happened at the container level. It was like these containers where the controller for the view that they were rendering.

Some of the reasoning to use containers with all the extra tooling we have to manage state is still relevant. This is why I still try to use the pattern. It looks a lot differt then how they looked years ago, but.

### Do you **need** the pattern

If your application has complex stateful components that require a lot of business logic, then using React containers can help keep your components organized and make them easier to reason about. Additionally, if you prefer a more component-driven approach to managing state, then using React containers can help you achieve that.

That being said, there are now many state management libraries and tools available for managing state in React applications, such as Redux and the React Context API. These tools can make it easier to manage state across components and provide features like middleware and dev tools that can make development faster and more efficient.

Ultimately, whether or not to use the React container pattern in your application depends on your specific needs and preferences. You should consider factors like the size and complexity of your application, your experience with React, and the tools and libraries you are already using before deciding whether or not to use the React container pattern.

### Why I still use it

In conclusion, while state management in React applications has evolved significantly since the introduction of React containers, this pattern still has a place in modern React development. React containers provide a way to manage complex stateful logic in a modular and scalable way, and can help keep your components organized and easier to reason about.

Whether or not to use React containers in your application ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences, but it's clear that they still have value in certain situations. By using React containers, you can create more reusable and composable components that are easier to test and maintain.

As React development continues to evolve, it's important to keep an open mind about the different patterns and approaches available. By staying up-to-date on the latest tools and techniques, you can continue to improve your React skills and build better applications. Thanks for reading!
