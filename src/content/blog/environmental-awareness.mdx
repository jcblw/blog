## Journey to a new enviromental wellbeing

I am not sure about you, but I have a mission statement for life. I created one a few years back when hearing a talk from [Jeff Weiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/) at [Headpspace](https://headspace.com) when I worked there. It was a very interesting concept for me because it was a very general statement, that could make it super simple to make a decsion. Does this new job follow my mission statement? If no, I could immediatly say no. My missions statment at the time of writing this is:

> #### To increase access to new experiences around the world.

This may seem pretty vague and that is on purpose. I wanted enough specificity to make it easy to make a decision, but not so specific that I would be limited. When I hear this statement I think travel, outdoors, aventure, and also preservation. Preservation since if the experience goes away then no one has access to it. We find ourselves in a [climate crisis](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3246/nasa-says-2022-fifth-warmest-year-on-record-warming-trend-continues/), and there are some experiences that are simply becoming extinct.

I was in the market for a new job in the beginning of this year and thought I wanted to at least attempt to use my skillsets to help fight climate change. I stumbled on a listing for an app called Joro. Joro was super interesting to me for a number of reasons but one huge one was that I had no idea how well I was doing in terms of my carbon footprint. I felt I was doing well, but really I did not have the slightest idea of how to tell if I was. Having this information made it super easy to see my eviromental wellbeing.

## Joro: A Tool for tracking impact

I am only going to speak breifly of what Joro does. At the time of writting this I only have just started working there, and still have not explored all the offering Joro has.

Joro calculates your emissions based on transactions. Is it perfect? no. Does it open a window into your enviromental impact? Yes. I have been using the app for a little over a month now. I hooked up my credit cards to the appliction and watched in horror at the impact of some of my past purchases.

## Opening my eyes to my impact

I now see why climate change is complicated. I had some ideas, but really once seeing a break down from my transactions. It was a little more clear where I stood and it was not amazing.

## Enviromental wellbeing?

This is something that came up in a conversation with [Sanchali Pal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanchalipal/) and it makes total sense. Just a small time ago talking about mental health was unheard of, and enviromental wellbeing is another step. Like how is you health when it comes to your relationship with your enviroment.
