I blankly stare at my screen, not knowing what to do. This device which I have had toxic relationship with now does not seem to take shape of a friend, foe or lover. It's just a collection of electronic parts. Why did I allow this piece of equipment to have an abusive relationship with me.

The allure of connectedness seems to have faded from this device. Honestly it's day 3 and I wish this was 100% true. This clarity is something I only get to glimmer from time to time when being present in situations which I used to retreat to mindlessly using my phone. It feels good. It's like looking at a window and being fixated on my reflection, then to only to allow my eyes to adjust to take in the beauty that lies beyond the window. The month of August I pushed myself to gaze past my reflection and take all social media apps off my phone.

## How I got here.

I am addicted to my phone, and most likely so are you. I am often lost in my phone off in the webs of the internet somewhere. These giant companies have access to buzz, ring, and notify this device that we hold close to our heart. Sometimes this is a good thing, but more often then not I find that I am not happy with the way I end up using my phone.

I will often get stuck on these social media apps. I open these apps up with an intention. "I need to message Celine" or "I want to see that picture I posted earlier", but often I end up mindlessly scrolling through my feed. Almost instantly too. Its like you open the app and its setup to keep you there. The random rewards of likes and messages keeps me coming back to these applications. After all the A/B tests these companies have figured out how to exploit the human attention to their advantage.

## Taking action

I read the book Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport and it kind of lit a fire under me. Not to stop using these apps. Again, there is usefulness, and function to these applications. I wanted to change my mindset towards these apps. I want these apps to be a tool that I can pull levers and get value out of them. Wether that value is human connection or even some monetary value. I would like these apps to serve me.

I can get all the value I need out of these apps without them being on my phone. Following me around during the day. I already had experimented with removing these apps before. I'll remove Instagram, then install the web app, then reinstall the app again. All within a course of a week. I decided that I am going to try and form a habit, or put into better terms, try to get rid of a bad habit. I have been pretty good at devoting myself to do monthly challenges. Completing two monthly challenges this month already. Vegan for a month, and minimal waste for a month. This one would be tougher for me due to the nature of my profession and the forces that work to keep me staring at my phone.

The parameters of experiment are as follows.

- Remove, or disable social media apps on my phone.
- Allow for usage of social media on desktop but also try to keep that to a minimum. This is to avoid the need to reinstall and app because I only talk to someone on a certain app.

## What did not go so well.

I would like to pretend that everything was perfect. As if the thought of reinstalling the app never pass through my mind. I never did reinstall the apps but there is a few things that did not go as planned.

I quickly found out that my browser is a portal to the world I was trying to avoid with this experiment. I essentially would get an email from Twitter and click through not even thinking about it. Suddenly, I was starring at the beast of social media right in the eyes. This would happen from time to time and I just made sure leave, and close the tab on my browser in a timely fashion. Was there times I ended up staying longer then a I wanted? Of course, I did. Making sure to close the tab was very key too. I had to go into the browser for a few things throughout the day and it was best not having the social media app open in my view while going into the browser.

Another thing that I had to deal with is my obsession with YouTube, and funnily enough on my Android phone I can not uninstall the app. I did disable the application, but this has been, to me, the hardest part of this whole experiment. YouTube is one of those app that you can find meaning in right away. Want to cook a certain dish? There a video for that. Need to fix an appliance? There is a video for that too. Youtube has a wealth of knowledge, and it is hard to quarantine the app. During my experiment I use to give myself a hard time when watching videos, but after a while I let it go and that was for the better. Essentially I just set some time towards the end of the day for entertainment and stuck to it.

Overall I think I achieved what I was hoping for with this experiment and the benefits I received far out-weighted any negatives.

## My feelings, and findings.

Typing this at the end of the 30 days its feels like I have not had the app for ever and, to be honest, am debating if I am going to install them back on my phone. My relationship with my phone has totally changed.

90% of the time on my phone is now what I would consider, time well spent. I do not find that I am mindlessly scrolling through feeds. The extra time that I got from not doing this has been amazing. I have read more this month then prior months. I have started writing more often. I am hanging out with friends more often. I am stronger then ever in my meditation practice. There is so many wonderful things that has happened this past month to me. Can I say its all because I took these app off my phone? No of course not, but I do think all the extra interactions I have had are a catalyst for all these things happening.

I did have a few people that said that they missed me on social media. This is what I expected, and these were people that I interacted with outside social media a lot anyways. One most notably with my mother. She had came to visit me for a couple of days. I told her about the experiment and she exclaimed that she loved to see what I was up to all the time. That being said she said she now was more compelled to call me to chat on the phone to catch up. I agreed with her a phone call was much better then a seeing a post on Instagram.

I think in this next month I am going to continue the experiment, or life without social media apps. Maybe I'll download one sometime in the future. I think this experiment make me thing that time boxing your social media usage is a great way to cope with the attention pull of these apps. I would encourage anyone reading this to try this experiment out. It can be tough at first but over time you may wonder if you needed social media in the first place.
