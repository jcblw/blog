# Blog of jcblw

This is the source code for my blog, [jcblw.com](https://jcblw.com). It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a new static site generator that uses React components, JSX, and TypeScript.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this blog, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ talks/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where I like to put any Astro/React components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
